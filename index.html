        <h2>Personal Project</h2>
        <p>Website created for a gymnastics club: <a href="https://agcm.pt" target="_blank">Visit Site</a></p>
        <p>This project began with a template, which I extensively customized to meet the specific needs of the club. I adapted the layout and design to align with the club's branding and added custom features to enhance user experience. The result is a responsive, user-friendly website that effectively showcases the club's activities and values.</p>
